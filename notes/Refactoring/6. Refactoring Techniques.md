## Composing Methods
Excessively long methods are the root of all evil. 

The following techniques remove code duplication and ==pave the way for future improvements==.

- Extract Method
- Inline Method
- Extract Variable
- Inline Temp
- Replace Temp with Query
- Split Temporary Variable
- Remove Assignments to Parameters
- Replace Method with Method Object
- Substitute Algorithm

## Moving Features between Objects
Even if you have distributed functionality among different classes in a less-than-perfect way, ==there is still hope==.

The following refactoring techniques show how to safely move functionality between classes, create new classes, and hide implementation details from public access.

- Move Method
- Move Field
- Extract Class ‚ûï
- Inline Class
- Hide Delegate ü´£
- Remove Middle Man üñï
- Introduce Foreign Method üö£
- Introduce Local Extension

## Organizing Data
The following refactoring techniques help with data handling, replacing primitives with rich class functionality. 

Another important result is <u>untangling of class associations</u>, which makes classes more ==portable== and ==reusable==.

- Change Value to Reference
- Change Reference to Value
- Duplicate Observed Data
- Self Encapsulate Field
- Replace Data Value with Object
- Replace Array with Object
- Change Unidirectional Association to Bidirectional ‚û°Ô∏è
- Change Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional‚¨ÖÔ∏è
- Encapsulate Field
- Encapsulate Collection
- Replace Magic Number with Symbolic Constant ü™Ñ
- Replace Type Code with Class
- Replace Type Code with Subclasses
- Replace Type Code with State/Strategy
- Replace Subclass with Fields

## Simplifying Conditional Expressions
Conditionals tend to get more and more complicated in their logic over time.

- Consolidate Conditional Expression
- Consolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments
- Decompose Conditional üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Replace Conditional with Polymorphism 
- Remove Control Flag üö©
- Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses
- Introduce Null Object üöÄ
- Introduce Assertion

## Simplifying Method Calls
The following techniques make method calls simpler and easier to understand. This, ==simplifies the interfaces== for interaction between classes.

- Add Parameter
- Remove Parameter
- Rename Method
- Separate Query from Modifier
- Parameterize Method
- Introduce Parameter Object
- Preserve Whole Obnkect
- Remove Sertting Method
- Replace Parameter with Explicit Methods
- Replace Parameter withMethod Call
- Hide Method
- Replace Constructor with Factory Method
- Replace Error Code with Exception
- Replace Exceptions with Test

## Dealing with Generalization
Abstraction has its own group of refactoring techniques, primary associated with ==moving functionalities along the class inheritance hierarchy==, <u>creating new classes and interfaces, and replacing inheritance with delegation</u> and vice versa.

- Pull Up Field
- Pull Up Method
- Pull Up Constructor Body
- Push Down Field üîΩ
- Push Down Method üîΩ
- Extract Subclass ‚ûñ
- Extract Supperclass ‚ûñ
- Extract Interface ‚ûñ
- Collapse Hierarchy
- Form Template Method
- Replace Inheritance with Delegation ‚¨ÖÔ∏è
- Replace Delegation with Inheritance ‚û°Ô∏è
