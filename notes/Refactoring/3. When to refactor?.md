Criteria to do refactoring. Knowing when is as important as knowing how.

### Rule of Three
1. Get it right on the first try
2. When doing something similar for the **second time** <u>CRINGE</u> at having to repeat but do the same thing anyway
3. When you're doing something for the third time, **start refactoring**

### When adding a feature
- Refactoring helps you understand other people's code. If you have to deal with someone elseâ€™s dirty code, try to refactor it first
- Easier to add new features

### When fixing a bug
Clean your code and the errors will practically discover themselves.

### During a code review
*Pair programming with authors is recommended*
