Refactoring should be done as a series of small changes, each of which makes the existing code slightly better while still leaving the program in working order.

## Checklist of refactoring
- <u>The code should become cleaner</u>
	- Move away with small changes instead of one big change.
	- When working with extremely sloppy code, think about rewriting entire parts of the code. **Takes more time**, **Testing**,**Ensure the code WILL become cleaner**.
- <u>New functionality shouldn't be created during refactoring</u>
	- Do not mix refactoring and developing new features.
- <u>All existing tests must pass after refactoring</u>
	- There are two cases when tests can break down after refactoring:
		- **You made an error during refactoring.** This one is a no-brainer: go ahead and fix the error.
		- **Your tests were too low-level.** For example, you were testing private methods of classes.
	- In this case, the tests are to blame. Therefore:
		- Write a entire new set of higher-level tests.
		- Use BDD-style tests. [[Behavior-driven development]]
