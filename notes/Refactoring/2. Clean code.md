Fight technical debt. Transform a mess into clean code and a simple design. `KISS (Keep it simple stupid)`

#### What is clean code then?
Some guidelines

- **Clean code is obvious for other programmers**
	- Poor variable naming
	- Bloated classes and methods
	- Magic numbers
	- Sloppy and difficult to grasp
- **Clean code doesn't contain duplication**
	- Having to change multiple code.
	- Increased cognitive load
	- Slows down the process
	- Prone to errors (Copy/paste can be üèñÔ∏è)
- **Clean code contains a minimal number of classes and other moving parts**
	- Less code is less stuff to keep in your head
	- Less is more
	- Less maintenance
	- Less bugs
	- Must keep short and simple
- **Clean code passes all tests**
	- Code passes tests...
	- Test coverage
- **Clean code is easier and cheaper to maintain**
